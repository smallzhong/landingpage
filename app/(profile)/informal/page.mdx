Pretending to be an extrovert, but hardly ever succeed.
I enjoy being alone, but I also love to hang out with friends.
I cherish the time I spend with my friends and family.

In my spare time, I enjoy hiking and traveling. I love both being in the nature and exploring the city.
I love rivers, lakes, oceans. Just every landscape with water. Watching the sunset on the beach is my favorite thing to do.

I'm a huge fan of sci-fi. Star Trek Voyager is my favorite series.

I used to play digital synthesizers, but haven't played for a long time.
