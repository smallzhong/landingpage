BSc in Computer Science @ Shanghai Jiao Tong University :it[(2019 - present)]

Generally interested in PL concepts and techniques that helps people build *correct* and *efficient* software, especially in a correct-by-construction way. I mainly worked on deductive verification and compiler correctness, and also did some work on DSL design and synthesis.

::p[And now, I'm interested in:]{.mb-0}
- Composable and expressive *semantics* (e.g. [Interaction Trees](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3371119))
- Interesting *language features* like staging and effect systems
- Beautiful and practical *type theory and systems* (e.g. row polymorphism, gradual typing, session types, etc.)
- Stuff that might rescue us from tedious proof engineering (e.g. proof synthesis and [better HCI](https://hazel.org/))

I'm actively applying for PhD programs in PL.\
